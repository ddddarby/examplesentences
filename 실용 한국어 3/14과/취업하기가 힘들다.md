요즘 같은 불경기에는 취업하기가 정말 힘들어요.

In this kind of recession, getting a job is really difficult.

경험이 부족해서 취업하기가 힘든 것 같아요.

I think it’s hard to get a job because I lack experience.

취업하기가 힘들다 보니 많은 사람들이 공무원을 준비해요.

Since finding a job is hard, many people prepare for government jobs.

졸업한 지 오래돼서 이제는 취업하기가 더 힘든 느낌이에요.

It’s been a while since I graduated, so it feels even harder to get a job now.

원하는 분야에서 취업하기가 생각보다 훨씬 힘들어요.

Getting a job in the field I want is much harder than I expected.

자격증도 있고 열심히 준비했는데 여전히 취업하기가 힘들어요.

Even though I have certificates and studied hard, it’s still hard to get hired.

취업하기가 힘들어서 일단 아르바이트를 시작했어요.

Because I couldn’t get a job, I started with a part-time job instead.

취업하기가 힘들다고 해서 포기하고 싶진 않아요.

Even though it’s hard to get a job, I don’t want to give up.

요즘은 스펙이 좋아도 취업하기가 힘든 시대예요.
These days, even people with great resumes have trouble getting jobs.

취업하기가 힘들수록 멘탈 관리가 정말 중요한 것 같아요.
The harder it is to get a job, the more important it is to manage your mindset.
